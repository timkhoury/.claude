# File includes - folder-based with auto-discovery
# Trailing / indicates folder (auto-discovers all .md files)
# Individual files still supported for special cases

# Rule bundles for different agent types
# Use $includes.folder for all files in folder
# Use $includes.folder.fileName for specific file (camelCase)

  # Full implementation rules for task-implementer
  # Customize: add $includes.project.yourRule for project-specific rules
  implementation:

  # Rules for code reviewers (validates against these)

# CUSTOMIZATION: Add your project-specific skills and rules to the appropriate sections.

  # Core pattern skills - customize for your stack
  # Example: ui-patterns, nextjs-patterns, supabase, etc.

  # Full implementation skills (patterns + gitbutler for commits)

# File includes - modular rule files
# These are file paths that get prepended to agent bodies

# Project-Specific Agent Configuration
#
# Project rules are auto-discovered from .claude/rules/project/*.md
# Bundle assignment is controlled by frontmatter in each rule file:
#
#   ---
#   bundles: all                              # All bundles
#   bundles: [implementation, review]         # Specific bundles
#   ---
#
# Default (no frontmatter): [implementation, review, planning]
#
# NOT synced to template.

# Explicit overrides (optional)
# These are prepended BEFORE auto-discovered rules.
#
# Example:
#   ruleBundles:
#     implementation:
#       - $includes.project.specialRule    # Prepended to implementation bundle
#     custom:
#       - $includes.project.overview       # Create new bundle

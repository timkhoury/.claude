# Global Claude Code Preferences

Personal preferences applied across all projects.

## Git Workflow

- **Use GitButler** when available - invoke `gitbutler` skill before git operations
- **Conventional commits** - `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `test:`, `perf:`
- **Single-line commit messages** - no body, no footers, no Co-Authored-By
- **Never push automatically** - only push when explicitly requested or at session end

## Code Style

- **No emojis** in code, commits, or UI copy unless explicitly requested
- **Professional tone** - no exclamation marks, no marketing speak
- **Minimal changes** - only modify what's directly requested, avoid scope creep

## Communication

- **Concise responses** - get to the point, avoid filler
- **No time estimates** - don't predict how long tasks will take
- **Cite file:line** when referencing code locations

## Session Management

- **Track multi-step work** - use appropriate tracking (beads, TodoWrite, or project-specific)
- **Land the plane** - ensure all work is committed and pushed before ending
- **Document remaining work** - don't leave loose ends undocumented
